## Getting Started

Before you can run the server you need a mongodb-string. This will be the uri of your MongoDB server. An example is: "mongodb://localhost:27017/codenames". After that's setup you can run the following:

### `npm start`

This will run a nodemon that will launch the GraphQL server on port 4000.
